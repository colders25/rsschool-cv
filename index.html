        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am an IT Engineer, service engineer (repair orgtechnics), "any-key" specialist :). I want to learn Javascript so I can become a junior developer. In the past, I had experience writing programs in C++ (using C++ Builder). At the university, I was writing an expression parser for the situational modeling system we are developing. It was my first experience of working in a team. Unfortunately, online resources for teamwork were not distributed at that time). After university I mainly wrote programs for the needs of the state institution where I worked. I have a high ability to learn, and I want to learn new things. I want to keep up with the times.</p>
